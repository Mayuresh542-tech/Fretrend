// Custom Brand Voice — shared, framework-agnostic config.

// Imported by BOTH client code (Settings cards, the active-voice badge) and the
// server-side content-kit / platform-kit route handlers, so this file must stay
// free of any React or "use client" — it's plain data plus pure functions.
//
// The user's chosen voice is persisted to profiles.brand_voice (+ brand_voice_custom
// for the free-text option) by migration 0009, then injected into the Groq system
// prompt so every generated title, hook, and script matches their tone.
